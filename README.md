# Py4j-ludii-example
 A git repository with instructions and an example on how to use jpy with Ludii.

# Get this example working

1. pip install Py4j with the instructions in the following link:

 https://www.py4j.org/install.html#install-instructions

2. Clone this git repository.

3. Resolve the maven library dependencies with Py4j.jar and Ludii.jar. The Py4j.jar should be in the folder where the Py4j python library was installed in your operating system.

4. Run the file ucy.py before running LaunchLudii.java as the project main class.

5. Run the project with LaunchLudii.java as the main class. After this, there should be an AI option in Ludii called UCT_py that runs with python.

# Altering the code

To alter the ai code, you must change the file ucy.py.
